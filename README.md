# 👋 Hi there,

I'm Ahmed Abdelaziz

🚀 **Embedded Systems Engineer** passionate about building robust Yocto-based Linux distributions and developing C++/Python applications for IoT, Image Processing, and STM32 platforms.

🌐 I'm currently diving deep into the world of **Embedded Linux**, working hands-on with:
-  **Yocto Project**: Customizing builds, kernels, and U-Boot systems
-  **C++/Python**: Applying object-oriented principles to real-time applications
-  **Low-level development** on STM32 and Raspberry Pi

🔍 In my GitHub repos, you'll find:
-  Modular code with clean architecture and best practices
-  Proof-of-concept demos in Embedded C/C++, Python, and shell
-  Work-in-progress ideas with a focus on real-world integration

📫 **Let's Connect**: [aiaaziz.sw@gmail.com](mailto:aiaaziz.sw@gmail.com)

💡 I’m a self-driven learner and problem-solver, always ready to take on a challenge. I thrive on building solutions that connect code to meaningful outcomes.
